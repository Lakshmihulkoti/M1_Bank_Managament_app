# Soil Moisture Sensor( YL-69) :

## Abstract : 
Soil Moisture Sensor is an electronic component and it is also called hygrometer ,it is usually used to measure the moisuture content in soil, this sensor measures the volumentric content of water inside the soil and it gives moisture level as output and this sensor reminds the user to water their plants and also monitord the moisture content of soil it has been widely used in agriculture,land irrigation and botanical gardening.


## Introduction :       
Soil Moisture Sensors also enable us to develop smart agricultural systems that respond to environmental conditions automatically.It can also use it to measure water level by using multiple moisture sensors,and it can measure the levels of moisture in the soil so it can be extremely useful if you want to monitor the soil moisture of your plants or automate the watering procedure.

## Benifits :
* They reduce the time.
* Improve the fertility of the soil.
* Decrease the use of water.
* They increase the price and demand of the products.
