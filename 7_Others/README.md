## MULTIPLE INPUT DC-DC CONVERTER TOPOLOGY FOR HYBRID ENERGY SYSTEM 
 # Abstract :
Power electronics DC-DC converters are being widely used in various applications like hybrid Vehicles , aerospace, satellite applications and portable electronics. In the recent past a lot of research and development has been carried out to enhance their liability, efficiency, modularity and cost effectiveness of these converters .The proposed multiple-input DC/DC converter is proficient for energy diversification from renewable and storage energy sources individually or simultaneously. It can be operated in buck, boost and buck-boost modes of operation with the capability of bidirectional power flow to achieve desired voltage level on either side.
                                   DC-DC converters have made a successful transition from single input-single output to multi input-multi output converters. These converters are now able to interface different level and combine their advantages to feed the different level of outputs. Research is continued to bring down the cost and reduce the number of components while keeping the continuous improvement in the areas like reliability and efficiency of the overall system. The study of different multi input DC-DC converter topologies suggests that there is no single topology which can handle the entire polls of cost, reliability, flexibility, efficiency and modularity single handed. This project presents some of the recent trends in the development of multi input and multi output DC-DC converters. Methods to synthesize multi input converters, their operational principles, merits and demerits are studied. A multi input buck-buck topology is studied and simulated using MATLAB Simulink Software  
                                   
 # Introduction :
 The system consists of several input energy sources, integrated through a multi-input 
power electronics converters that could accommodate a variety of input sources and 
combine their advantages to deliver a controlled output for diversified applications. 
ÔÅµ Due to their simple structure, minimum number of conversion stages and less devices, 
these multiport power electronics converters have been presented for a number of 
applications like hybrid energy systems, hybrid vehicles, satellite/aerospace applications 
and uninterrupted power supplies.
